Conversely, to consume a variable, function, class, interface, etc. exported from a different module, it has to be imported using one of the import forms.
// modules are declarative; the relationships between modules are specified in terms of imports and exports at the file level.
// modules import one another using a module loader. At runtime the module loader is responsible for locating and executing all dependencies of a module before executing it. Popular JavaScript module loaders used in web applications are the CommonJS module loader for Node.js and Require.js module loader for Web applications.
// modules are declarative; the relationships between modules are specified in terms of imports and exports at the file level and are enforced by a compiler.
// modules are evaluated synchronously; this means that if module A imports module B, module Bâ€™s declarations are not visible in module A until B is evaluated. However, if there is a circular import between modules A and B, then the modules are evaluated in the order in which they are referenced.

// OOP - Object Oriented Programming core concepts brief overview

// Inheritance - is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. It is an important part of object-oriented programming (OOP) in which one class acquires the properties (methods and fields) of another. With the use of inheritance the information is made manageable in a hierarchical order.
// encapsulation ( get / set) - is the mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit. In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class. Therefore, it is also known as data hiding.
// short example :

class Person {
    private name: string;
    private type: string;
    private age: number = 27;

    constructor(name: string, public username: string) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    printAge() {
        console.log(this.age);
        this.setType("Old Guy");
    }

    private setType(type: string) {
        this.type = type;
        console.log(this.type);
    }
}

// PolyMorphism - is the ability of a variable, function, or object to take on many forms. The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.
// Polymorphism reffering to interfaces and abstract classes - is a design principle that allows a class to be defined by its behavior and not by its attributes. Polymorphism is achieved by using abstract classes and interfaces.
// Polymorphism reffering to inheritance - is a design principle that allows a class to be defined by its behavior and not by its attributes. Polymorphism is achieved by using inheritance.

class Car {
    protected name: string;

    constructor(name: string) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    printName() {
        console.log(this.name);
    }
}

Abstraction - is the process of hiding the implementation details from the user, only the functionality will be provided to the user. In other words, the user will have the information on what the object does instead of how it does it.
// short example :

class Car {
    protected name: string;

    constructor(name: string) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    printName() {
        console.log(this.name);
    }
}

// Interfaces

// An interface is a syntactical contract that an entity should conform to. An interface defines the syntax that any entity must adhere to. Interfaces are used to achieve abstraction and also to support the concept of loose coupling in software design.
// Interfaces are similar to abstract classes. Both define abstract members that are implemented in derived classes. However, interfaces define only abstract members, whereas abstract classes can define both abstract and non-abstract members. In addition, interfaces cannot contain implementation for their members, whereas abstract classes can. Members of an interface are public by default.
// short example :

interface NamedPerson {
    firstName: string;
    age?: number;
    [propName: string]: any;
    greet(lastName: string): void;
}

function greet(person: NamedPerson) {
    console.log("Hello, " + person.firstName);
}

function changeName(person: NamedPerson) {
    person.firstName = "Anna";
}

const person: NamedPerson = {
    firstName: "Max",
    hobbies: ["Cooking", "Sports"],
    greet(lastName: string) {
        console.log("Hi, I am " + this.firstName + " " + lastName);
    }

}

greet(person);

//GRASP - General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns

// Creator - is a class that creates other objects. It is responsible for knowing which classes need to be instantiated. It is also responsible for knowing how the instances of these classes will be created and used.


class Person {
    private name: string;
    private age: number;

    constructor(name: string, age: number) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
}

class PersonFactory {
    static createPerson(name: string, age: number) {
        return new Person(name, age);
    }
}

const person = PersonFactory.createPerson('Max', 27);

// Controller - is a class that controls the flow of data between the view and the model. It is responsible for knowing which data needs to be displayed and when. It is also responsible for knowing which model objects need to be updated and when.


class Person {
    private name: string;
    private age: number;

        this.persons.push(person);
    }
}

const personController = new PersonController();

personController.addPerson('Max', 27);

// High Cohesion - is a measure of how strongly related the responsibilities of a class are. A class with high cohesion is focused on a single responsibility and has a small number of instance variables. A class with low cohesion has many responsibilities and many instance variables.

class Person {
    private name: string;

        this.persons.push(person);
    }
}

const personController = new PersonController();

personController.addPerson('Max', 27);

// Low Coupling - is a measure of how dependent one class is on another. A class with low coupling depends on as few other classes as possible. A class with high coupling depends on many other classes.

class Person {
    private name: string;
    private age: number;

    constructor(name: string, age: number) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;

        this.persons.push(person);
    }
}

const personController = new PersonController();

personController.addPerson('Max', 27);

// Inversion of Control - is a design principle that allows the control flow of a program to be inverted. Inversion of control is achieved by using a framework that takes control of the flow of a program and delegates the execution of tasks to other objects.


class Car {
    drive() {
        console.log('Driving...');
    }
}

class CarFactory {
    static createCar() {
        return new Car();

// Dependency Injection - is a design pattern that allows the removal of hard-coded dependencies and makes it possible to change them, whether at runtime or compile time.

class cat {
